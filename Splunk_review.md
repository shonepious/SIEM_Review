## **<mark><ins>Likelihood to Recommend** ü§ù
Splunk Enterprise is well-suited for any requirement to aggregate vast sums of data, no matter how structured or unstructured, and search across it all at speed, or report on it with visualizations, etc.

It's not suited for scenarios where you want to report on a single set of data, say, in a traditional way, for example, a typical scheduled report out of a finance system.
