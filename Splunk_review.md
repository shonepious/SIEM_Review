## **<mark><ins>Likelihood to Recommend** ü§ù
Splunk Enterprise is well-suited for any requirement to aggregate vast sums of data, no matter how structured or unstructured, and search across it all at speed, or report on it with visualizations, etc.

It's not suited for scenarios where you want to report on a single set of data, say, in a traditional way, for example, a typical scheduled report out of a finance system.

--------------------
Splunk Enterprise gives you options from where you can import or add data. The different options 
allow admins to add data from various directories and locations and analyse different types of data, 
such as network information, cloud data, operating system data, and security information.
![](Splunkwheretogetdatafrom.png)
--------------------
To demonstrate how adding data into Splunk works, I will add a tutorial.zip file which was downloaded from Splunk documentation.
We can upload .zip files into Splunk and it will automatically decompress the file and ingest it normally. 
Splunk will take you through the data adding process.
![](splunkaddingcv.png)
--------------------
- We then select the input settings, which allows you to set what the host does when the data is added.
- The format of the data is the source type. Leaving it as 'automatic' means Splunk can unzip the file or look at the log file formats inside it, 
and apply the appropriate source type. 
- The host value is just the name of the local host; in my case, this is 'shonepious'. 
- Indexing indicates where Splunk will store the new information. We can create a new Index location named 'test' for example, however, I will keep teh default
settings - this indexes the data in the main folder.

--------------------
Splunk will then give a final opportunity, to review our choices and submit the data entry.

--------------------
You can use search queries to manipulate the displayed data, to fine tune analysis.
![](splunkcvsearch.png)
--------------------
The search bar also allow boolean logic queries and parameters, which let you filter the data and further narrow your dataset for accurate and efficient analysis.

--------------------
Splunk Enterprise saves any data that you have added to an index file. You then have the ability, to create a custom
dashboard with this dataset for easy searching and analysis later.
